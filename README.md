# jene

A very simple experimental code gen tool

### Example Usage

```json
{
  "instructions": [
    "pkg:home.go:main",
    "f-start:sayHi:string:name,string salutation,string",
    "declare:email:int:i*1",
    "f-end",
    "f-start:sayBye:string:name,string salutation,string",
    "declare:friend:string:longtimefriend",
    "f-end"
  ]
}
```

Above input produces the below output in the home.go file

```go

// Code generated by go generate; DO NOT EDIT.
// This file was generated by JENE at 2020-07-12 20:24:20.153386 +0300 EAT m=+33.909365423
package main

func sayHi(name string, salutation string) string {
	email := 1
}

func sayBye(name string, salutation string) string {
	friend := "longtimefriend"
}

```

The instructions and input are separated by a ":" symbol . Endgoal is to be able to send json input to
an endpoint and receive a file with the codified response.

### To Run the App

Clone the REPO and run the below command

```
go run main.go

```
